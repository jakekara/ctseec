      Here's how much state candidates seeking office in 2018 have raised
      so far, according to totals through the end of 2017, based on State
      Elections Enforcement Commission Form 30 filings from January
      10. Some candidates have more than one committee listed below because
      they begin as exploratory committees and then form candidate
      committees. Candidates who raised less than $1,000 or did not file a
      SEEC Form 30 document are not listed below.
